# Playing Online 4-in-a-Row

These instructions are for playing Online 4-in-a-Row once the game is already set up and hosted online.

## Quick Start - Playing the Game Online

1.  **Open the Game URL in your Browser:**  Go to the web address (URL) where the Online 4-in-a-Row game is hosted using your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

2.  **Second Player Opens the Game URL:** Have the second player also open the *same game URL* in their web browser. They should use a different device or browser window from the first player.

3.  **Gameplay:**
    *   **Turns:** The game is turn-based. **Player 1 ('X') always goes first.** You'll see "Your turn" displayed on your screen when it's your turn to play.
    *   **Taking a Turn:** Click on an empty cell on the game board to place your piece in that position.
    *   **Objective:** Be the first player to connect **four of your pieces in a row** - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    *   **Game Status:** Look at the status message displayed above the game board to see whose turn it is, and to find out if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
    *   **Chat:** Use the chat window located on the right side of the screen to communicate with your opponent during the game.
    *   **New Game:** After a game finishes, either player can click the "New Game" button to start a new game.

## Rules of the Game

*   **Players:** The game is for two players.
*   **Objective:** Connect four of your pieces in a row before your opponent.
*   **Turns:** Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1 ('X').
*   **Placing Pieces:** On your turn, click on an empty cell on the game board to place your piece. Pieces virtually "drop" to the lowest available space in the column you click.
*   **Winning:** The first player to get four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
*   **Draw:** If the game board is completely filled and no player has achieved four-in-a-row, the game is a draw.

Enjoy playing Online 4-in-a-Row!
